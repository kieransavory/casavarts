        </div>

        <div class="centertext">
            <p>Recognised as Casavarts, or Chloe Savory, I am a self taught artist from the UK, exploring the realms within various paint and pencil mediums. Particularly notorious for a blend of 
                pop culture, streetwear, consumerism and politics, my style is ever adapting into a fun, bold yet also dark expression of my current interests and personal depictions of the world 
                around me.
                <br>
                <br>
                My style truly began to take shape within my sixth-form years, when I started to properly establish not only my artistic abilities, but also my perspective of the reality in which 
                we live. A lot of my work developed into a reflection of my feelings towards consumerism, materialism, war, objectification, climate change and drug use.
